We are announcing the launch of the **IKEA Furniture Assembly environment** as a first-of-its-kind benchmark for testing and accelerating the automation of physical assembly processes.
An agent (Sawyer, Baxter, Cursor) is required to move, align, and connect furniture parts sequentially.
The task is completed when all parts are connected.


The IKEA Furniture Assembly environment provides:
- Comprehensive modeling of **furniture assembly** task
- Multiple furniture models, backgrounds, lighting, textures, and more
- Realistic robot simulation (Baxter, Sawyer, and more)
- Gym interface for easy RL training

## A more comprehensive version will come in December, 2019
- [ ] 80+ Furniture models
- [ ] More robots and grippers (e.g. Jaco, Fetch)
- [ ] Reinforcement learning and imitation learning benchmark
- [ ] 3D mouse/VR controller
- [ ] Programmatic changes in lighting and textures

<br>

## (1) Example use cases

### (1.0) Installation
See [`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md) for installation.<br/>
If you are on a headless server, make sure you run a [virtual display](docs/installation.md#virtual-display-on-headless-machines) and use `--virtual_display` to specify the display number (e.g. :0 or :1).

### (1.1) Human control
You can use WASDQE keys for moving and IJKLUO keys for rotating an end-effector of an agent.
```bash
$ python demo_manual.py
```

### (1.2) RL Training
The Gym-like interface makes it easy to use the environment with various RL algorithms. Moreover, users can easily switch furniture models and backgrounds using `reset` method.
We refer the readers to [`furniture/demo_rl.py`](demo_rl.py) for more details.
```py
from env import make_env

# make environment by following arguments
env = make_env('FurnitureBaxterEnv')

# run one episode and collect transitions
done = False

# reset environment
observation = env.reset(furniture_id=1, background='Industrial')

while not done:
    # sample action from policy
    action = pi.act(observation)

    # update unity rendering
    env.render()

    # simulate environment
    observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```

Train block picking up with the provided SAC implementation. It requires 300k steps to pick up a block.
To use loggging, you need to change `furniture/rl/trainer.py:74` with your [wandb](https://wandb.com) entity name and set `--wandb True`.
```bash
# gpu: gpu number
$ python -m rl.main --env FurnitureBaxterBlockEnv --prefix demo --gpu 0 --reward_scale 3
```
See the [`furniture/rl`](rl) folder for a full SAC implementation that uses the IKEA furniture assembly environment.

### (1.3) Gym interface
Gym interface for the IKEA Furniture Assembly environment is also provided, but the furniture model and background should be predefined when registered (see `register` functions in [`furniture/env/__init__.py`](env/__init__.py).
```py
# More details, see furniture/demo_gym.py

import gym

# make an environment
env = gym.make('furniture-baxter-v0')

done = False

# reset environment
observation = env.reset()

while not done:
    # simulate environment
    observation, reward, done, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
```

### (1.4) Data generation and observation configuration
See the various observation types (RGB image, segmentation map, depth map,
robot joint state, furniture pose) and generate your own data.
It will show you the various observation options available
to the environment. The video generation can be RAM heavy, so
decrease `--screen_width` and `--screen_height` if it crashes.
There are pre-recorded demonstrations `sawyer_7.pkl, baxter_0.pkl, cursor_7.pkl` in the `demos` folder for
data generation.
```bash
$ python -m demo_vision
```

### (1.5) Demonstration recording and playback
The following script will take the user through the 1) playback of existing
demonstrations and 2) recording and playback of their own demos.
```bash
$ python -m demo_demonstration
```
